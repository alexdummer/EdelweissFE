Contact mechanics: theory
=========================

This page documents the theory of the node-to-deformable-surface contact stack implemented in
EdelweissFE: the discretization of contact surfaces into flat facets
(:mod:`~edelweissfe.elements.contactsurfaceelement`,
:mod:`~edelweissfe.generators.surfaceelementgenerator`), the gap kinematics in their finite-sliding
and small-sliding variants (:mod:`~edelweissfe.utils.facetcontactgeometry`,
:mod:`~edelweissfe.constraints.nodetodeformablesurfacepenalty`), the penalty and augmented-Lagrange
normal contact laws, Coulomb friction, and the integration into the implicit solver. Every formula
stated here is implemented literally in the referenced modules and has been verified against
independent finite differences, symbolic differentiation, or analytic benchmark solutions; the
verification methodology is summarized at the end.

The stack targets *small-deformation* applications with possibly *large relative sliding* along the
interface (e.g. anchorage problems: steel anchors in concrete channels, friction-dominated
capacity, curved bearing surfaces, quadratic solid elements).


Surface discretization
----------------------

Facet-based surface representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both sides of a contact pair are represented by *contact facet elements*: flat, material-less,
volume-less surface patches (``Tria3ContactFacet`` in 3D, ``Line2ContactFacet`` in 2D) attached to
the existing boundary nodes of a solid body. They carry no DOFs of their own -- they only expose
the current position and orientation of a flat patch as a function of their nodes' ordinary
displacement DOFs, which are shared with (and driven by) the solid elements referencing the same
nodes. Their element interface (``computeKernels`` etc.) is a no-op; all contact mechanics happens
in the constraint.

Because every facet is *exactly flat* -- a plane through 3 points, or a straight segment through 2
points -- its normal field has identically zero curvature over its own domain. The
second-fundamental-form (curvature) terms of classical curved-surface contact kinematics therefore
vanish by construction; the only geometric nonlinearity is the dependence of the facet's *own*
normal on its nodes' positions (see :ref:`finite-sliding-kinematics`).

A deliberate consequence of flat facets: the contact interpolation is always piecewise linear with
*non-negative* barycentric weights inside each facet. Any interpolation basis of polynomial degree
:math:`\geq 2` (serendipity Quad8, Lagrangian Quad9, quadratic Tria6 alike) has shape functions
that become negative somewhere on the face; a node-based contact scheme built on such a basis can
produce sign-indefinite force distributions. Flat facets avoid this hazard categorically.

Face triangulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The generator (:mod:`~edelweissfe.generators.surfaceelementgenerator`) builds facets from an
existing ``*surface`` definition via face-node-ordering tables transcribed from Marmot's own face
definitions -- the genuine Abaqus S1..S6 convention, which this codebase's ``Hexa8``/``Hexa20``
elements and mesh generators (``boxGen``: 1=Ymin, 2=Ymax, 3=Xmin, 4=Zmax, 5=Xmax, 6=Zmin) share.
Two triangulations are available for quadratic element faces:

``triangulation=corner``
    The face is reduced to its linear corner-node subset; a quad face becomes two Tria3 via a
    fixed diagonal, preserving the source face's outward winding. For hexa20, the midside nodes do
    not participate in contact at all. This is **exact for straight-edged meshes** (midside nodes
    at exact edge midpoints) and is the default.

``triangulation=midside``
    The full 8-node face boundary polygon :math:`(c_1, m_1, c_2, m_2, c_3, m_3, c_4, m_4)` is
    split into 4 corner triangles :math:`(m_{i-1}, c_i, m_i)` plus the central midside quad
    :math:`(m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4)` split into 2 triangles -- 6 flat Tria3 using only real nodes
    (2D quad8 edges: split at the midside node into 2 Line2). This is identical in coverage to
    the corner reduction for straight-edged meshes and **strictly more accurate for curved
    faces**, where the midside nodes carry real geometric information.

    A note on the construction: a naive fan from a *corner* over the same boundary polygon would
    contain the triangles :math:`(c_1, m_1, c_2)` and :math:`(c_1, c_4, m_4)`, which are *exactly
    degenerate* (zero area, collinear nodes) for straight edges, since the midside node lies on
    the corner-to-corner segment. The midside-quad split has no degenerate members.

The geometric error of a flat facet chording a curved face scales with the chord sagitta
:math:`s \approx |f''|\, c^2 / 8` (:math:`f` the surface profile, :math:`c` the chord length).
The midside triangulation halves the chords, reducing the sagitta -- i.e. the artificial gap
error -- by a factor of 4. This is not an academic refinement: on a cylindrical-arc interface
where the sagitta of the corner chords is of the order of the physical interference, the corner
reduction underestimates the total contact force by ~40 % on the identical mesh (regression test
``NodeToDeformableSurfaceContactCurvedHexa20`` and its manual variant ``test_corner.inp``).

All face tables (corner and midside) are verified numerically against the mesh generators' actual
node construction: face-plane membership, outward cross-product normals, non-degeneracy, exact
area tiling, and midside-between-corners positions, for every face of every supported element
type.

.. _tributary-areas:

Tributary areas and consistent lumping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The constraint's contact points are the unique nodes of the *slave* facet surface. Each slave
node :math:`s` carries a tributary area :math:`A_s`, and the penalty parameter acts per unit
area, so that the assembled nodal forces approximate a contact *pressure* distribution
:math:`p_s = -f_n^{(s)} / A_s` and the response is insensitive to slave-surface refinement.

The tributary areas are assembled from per-facet, per-node *area shares* assigned by the
generator. The choice of shares is not arbitrary -- it must be **consistent with the nodal force
distribution that the solid body itself delivers to its boundary for a uniform pressure**,
otherwise the force-vs-area mismatch appears as spurious pressure oscillation even on perfectly
matching meshes:

* For a **bilinear quad face**, the consistent nodal forces of a uniform pressure are
  :math:`p\,A/4` per corner -- uniquely. An equal per-triangle split (:math:`A_\triangle/3` per
  triangle node) instead depends on which nodes lie on the arbitrary diagonal, and differs from
  :math:`A/4` by up to a factor 4/3. The generator therefore assigns each corner
  :math:`A_{\text{face}}/4`, distributed evenly over the triangles of that face containing it.
  With this lumping the two-block **contact patch test** with matching meshes passes to machine
  precision (per-slave pressure spread :math:`\sim 10^{-11}` against the analytic uniform
  pressure); with the naive per-triangle split, the spread is :math:`\sim 0.7`.

* For the **central midside quad** of the midside triangulation, the same quad-consistent lumping
  is applied (removing the diagonal-dependence asymmetry among midside nodes). For a
  straight-edged hexa20 face the resulting shares are symmetric: :math:`A/24` per corner and
  :math:`5A/24` per midside node.

* For **serendipity (quad8/hexa20) faces, exact pointwise pressure consistency is fundamentally
  unattainable regardless of the weights**: the consistent nodal forces of a uniform pressure on
  a quad8 face are *negative* at the corners (:math:`-p\,A/12`, with :math:`+p\,A/3` at the
  midsides). A unilateral per-node spring scheme cannot exert tensile nodal forces; the discrete
  solution responds with corner micro-liftoff and locally redistributed pressures. This is the
  classical quadratic-element limitation of all node-based contact schemes (the reason
  commercial codes discourage node-to-surface contact on 20-node bricks), and it bounds what
  pressure fidelity can be expected from hexa20 slave surfaces. Total forces and mean pressures
  remain correct (they follow from global equilibrium).

* On **non-matching meshes**, node-to-surface contact transfers each slave nodal force to the
  master facet nodes by the (non-negative, partition-of-unity) barycentric weights of the contact
  point. This is *not* the consistent load distribution of a smooth pressure on the master
  discretization; the master surface responds with micro-scale dishing between its nodes, and at
  interface stiffnesses far above the bulk stiffness the resulting gap variations map into
  pointwise pressure oscillation (measured: relative spread :math:`\sim 0.5` for a 3x3-on-2x2
  interface, with exact total force and mean pressure; manual variant
  ``NodeToDeformableSurfaceContactPatch/test_mismatched.inp``). Eliminating this pointwise error
  on non-matching meshes is precisely what mortar/segment-to-segment methods buy -- and the
  measured spread is this project's quantified tripwire for ever adopting one.


Gap kinematics
--------------

Throughout, :math:`\boldsymbol{x}_s` denotes the current position of a slave node and
:math:`\boldsymbol{x}_a,\; a = 1 \ldots k` the current positions of the assigned master facet's
nodes (:math:`k = 3` for Tria3, :math:`k = 2` for Line2). The generalized coordinate vector of
one contact pair is :math:`\boldsymbol{q} = [\boldsymbol{x}_s, \boldsymbol{x}_1, \ldots,
\boldsymbol{x}_k]`.

.. _finite-sliding-kinematics:

Finite sliding: exact gap, gradient, and Hessian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the finite-sliding formulation (``sliding=finite``), the gap and its exact first and second
derivatives are recomputed from the *current Newton iterate* in every iteration -- no geometry is
frozen within an increment.

For a Tria3 facet, the unit normal is constructed by cross-product-then-normalize,

.. math::

   \boldsymbol{c} = (\boldsymbol{x}_2 - \boldsymbol{x}_1) \times (\boldsymbol{x}_3 -
   \boldsymbol{x}_1), \qquad m = \lVert \boldsymbol{c} \rVert, \qquad \boldsymbol{n} =
   \boldsymbol{c} / m,

and the gap is the signed plane distance

.. math::

   g(\boldsymbol{q}) = \boldsymbol{n} \cdot (\boldsymbol{x}_s - \boldsymbol{x}_1),

positive outside the facet's half-space, negative when penetrating. (In 2D, :math:`\boldsymbol{n}`
is the edge direction rotated by :math:`-90^\circ` and normalized, consistent with a
counter-clockwise traversal of the solid's boundary.)

The gradient :math:`\boldsymbol{w} = \partial g / \partial \boldsymbol{q}` follows from the chain
rule with

.. math::

   \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{n}}{\partial \boldsymbol{x}_a} = \frac{1}{m} \left( \boldsymbol{I}
   - \boldsymbol{n} \otimes \boldsymbol{n} \right) \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{c}}{\partial
   \boldsymbol{x}_a},

where :math:`\partial \boldsymbol{c} / \partial \boldsymbol{x}_a` are constant skew-symmetric
(cross-product) matrices of the edge vectors. Because the facet is flat, the *only* second-order
term in the Hessian :math:`\boldsymbol{H} = \partial^2 g / \partial \boldsymbol{q}^2` is the
pose-dependence of the normal's own construction (the derivative of the
normalize-the-cross-product map) -- there is **no curvature term**. The closed forms comprise
three contributions per node-pair block: the derivative of the tangent-plane projector, the
derivative of the skew arguments, and the derivative of the normalization denominator. They were
derived by hand and cross-verified against exact symbolic differentiation (SymPy) and independent
central finite differences to machine precision at many random non-degenerate configurations; see
the warning in :mod:`~edelweissfe.utils.facetcontactgeometry` -- this normalize/rotate
second-derivative algebra is very easy to get subtly wrong, and the module must not be hand-edited
without re-verification.

The slave is assigned to its single closest facet (by facet centroid distance) once per increment,
from the last converged configuration. Within the increment, an exact in-facet containment test
(barycentric for Tria3, parametric for Line2) gates the contribution: if the projection of the
slave leaves the assigned facet mid-Newton, no contact is assembled for that slave until the next
connectivity update. Two non-smoothness sources follow: the facet-normal snap when the closest
point crosses a facet seam, and the mid-increment containment loss ("dead zones" at facet edges
and corners, where a penetrating node can temporarily carry no force). Both are accepted
limitations of this formulation -- and both *vanish identically* in the small-sliding formulation,
which is the recommended one for the target applications.

.. _small-sliding-kinematics:

Small sliding: frozen closest-point projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the small-sliding formulation (``sliding=small``, in the sense of the classical
"small-sliding" contact of implicit FE codes), the closest-point projection of each slave onto
the master surface is computed once per increment from the last converged configuration and
**frozen for all Newton iterations of that increment**:

1. For every master facet, the true closest point of the *closed* facet domain is computed --
   interior, edge, or vertex -- via the barycentric region classification (Ericson's real-time
   collision detection test), yielding clamped, non-negative weights
   :math:`\bar{N}_a \geq 0,\; \sum_a \bar{N}_a = 1`. The facet with the smallest true distance is
   assigned. Because the *closed* domain is used, there is no dead zone at facet seams: a node
   beyond a facet's edge clamps to that edge or vertex and remains loadable.

2. The assigned facet's unit normal :math:`\bar{\boldsymbol{n}}` and the clamped weights
   :math:`\bar{N}_a` are frozen. The gap of the current iterate is then

   .. math::

      g(\boldsymbol{q}) = \bar{\boldsymbol{n}} \cdot \Big( \boldsymbol{x}_s - \sum_a \bar{N}_a\,
      \boldsymbol{x}_a \Big),

   which is **linear in the displacement DOFs**: the gradient is the constant vector

   .. math::

      \boldsymbol{w} = \boldsymbol{c} \otimes \bar{\boldsymbol{n}}, \qquad \boldsymbol{c} = [1,
      -\bar{N}_1, \ldots, -\bar{N}_k],

   (Kronecker-product block structure) and the geometric Hessian term vanishes identically.

Both non-smoothness sources of finite sliding disappear; the only remaining switch is the
gap-sign activation. The formulation is variationally the linearization of the contact kinematics
about the last converged state -- consistent with a small-deformation setting, where the solid
elements are linearized anyway, while still permitting arbitrarily large *accumulated* sliding
through the per-increment re-projection. It is also the necessary basis for the frictional
return mapping (constant tangent frame within the increment).

The relative displacement mapping used throughout normal and frictional contact is the constant
matrix

.. math::

   \boldsymbol{G} = \boldsymbol{c} \otimes \boldsymbol{I}, \qquad \boldsymbol{u}_{rel} =
   \boldsymbol{G}\, \boldsymbol{q} = \boldsymbol{x}_s - \sum_a \bar{N}_a \boldsymbol{x}_a,

with the identities :math:`\boldsymbol{G}^T \boldsymbol{M} \boldsymbol{G} = (\boldsymbol{c}
\otimes \boldsymbol{c}^T) \otimes \boldsymbol{M}` and :math:`\boldsymbol{G}^T \boldsymbol{v} =
\boldsymbol{c} \otimes \boldsymbol{v}` used verbatim in the implementation.


Normal contact
--------------

Penalty force laws
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contact is active for :math:`g < 0`. With :math:`\kappa = p\, A_s` (``penalty`` :math:`p`, an
interface stiffness modulus per unit area, times the tributary area), two force laws are
available; :math:`f_n \leq 0` denotes the normal force carried by the slave node (compression
negative), assembled as :math:`\boldsymbol{P}^{ext} \mathrel{-}= f_n\, \boldsymbol{w}`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 14 22 22 42

   * - law
     - potential :math:`\Pi(g)`
     - force :math:`f_n`, stiffness :math:`\partial f_n / \partial g`
     - activation smoothness
   * - ``linear``
     - :math:`\tfrac{1}{2} \kappa g^2`
     - :math:`\kappa g`, :math:`\kappa`
     - force :math:`C^0`; stiffness jumps by :math:`\kappa` at :math:`g = 0`
   * - ``quadratic``
     - :math:`-\tfrac{1}{6} \kappa g^3`
     - :math:`-\tfrac{1}{2} \kappa g^2`, :math:`-\kappa g`
     - force :math:`C^1`; stiffness continuous (:math:`\to 0`) at :math:`g = 0`

The sign convention matters: the quadratic force must carry the sign of :math:`g` (i.e.
:math:`f_n = -\tfrac{1}{2}\kappa g^2 < 0` in contact) so that the shared assembly expression
remains repulsive; the consistent stiffness is then :math:`-\kappa g > 0`.

The choice of law is not cosmetic. For frictionless contact both work; **in combination with
friction, the quadratic law is strongly recommended**: the frictional slip tangent contains a
nonsymmetric term proportional to :math:`\mu \, \partial f_n / \partial g` (see
:ref:`friction-tangent`). With the linear law this term switches on and off with the full
magnitude :math:`\mu \kappa` at gap activation; nodes lifting off or touching down at a tilting
contact edge (e.g. the trailing edge of a dragged block) then make Newton limit-cycle *independent
of the increment size* -- observed as a residual two-cycle persisting down to increments of
:math:`10^{-6}`. With the quadratic law, both the normal and the mu-scaled frictional tangent
vanish continuously at activation, and the same problems converge without cutbacks.

The consistent contribution of one active slave to the tangent is

.. math::

   \boldsymbol{K} = \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial g}\, \boldsymbol{w} \otimes \boldsymbol{w} +
   f_n\, \boldsymbol{H},

where :math:`\boldsymbol{H} \equiv \boldsymbol{0}` for small sliding.

.. _augmented-lagrange:

Augmented Lagrange (incremental Uzawa)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With ``augmentedLagrange=True`` (requires ``sliding=small``), each slave carries a persistent
normal traction multiplier :math:`\lambda_s \leq 0` (a force), and the contact force becomes

.. math::

   f_n = \lambda_s + f_n^{pen}(g),

with the penalty part :math:`f_n^{pen}` of the chosen law for :math:`g<0` and zero at open gaps.
Contact is assembled whenever :math:`g < 0` *or* :math:`\lambda_s < 0`; at an open gap with a
lingering multiplier, the constant force :math:`\lambda_s \boldsymbol{w}` is applied without any
stiffness, and the multiplier decays within a few increments (see below). Since
:math:`\lambda_s` is **constant within an increment, it contributes nothing to the tangent and
cannot destabilize Newton** -- the entire algorithmic character of the penalty method is
retained.

On increment acceptance, the multiplier is updated by the *converged penalty force part*
(incremental Uzawa):

.. math::

   \lambda_s \leftarrow \min\big(0,\; \lambda_s + f_n^{pen}(g_{conv})\big),

with the linear release measure :math:`\kappa\, g_{conv} > 0` at open gaps. The law-dependence of
the update is essential and easy to get wrong: the textbook update :math:`\lambda \leftarrow
\lambda + \kappa g` *is* the penalty force only for the linear law, where it transfers the spring
force to the multiplier in one step. Under the quadratic law the converged gap scales as
:math:`g \sim -\sqrt{2 N / \kappa}` for a nodal force :math:`N`, so :math:`\kappa g \sim
-\sqrt{2 \kappa N}` overshoots the required traction by :math:`\sqrt{\kappa / (2N)}` -- orders of
magnitude at practical penalties (observed: per-node multipliers ~100x the nodal force, total
normal force spiking 40x, cutback cascade). Updating by the penalty *force* restores the
one-step transfer property for both laws.

Consequences: at fixed penalty the penetration is driven toward zero over the increments (the
multiplier progressively carries the load), so the **penalty can be reduced by an order of
magnitude or more** (conditioning, smoother switches) while the solution moves *closer* to the
rigid-constraint limit than a pure penalty at the stiff value. The friction cone :math:`\mu N`
(below) uses the multiplier-augmented normal force -- a sharper cone than the pure penalty
estimate.


Coulomb friction
----------------

Interface plasticity and the necessity of state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Coulomb friction is rate-independent plasticity on the interface: yield function
:math:`\phi = \lVert \boldsymbol{t}_T \rVert - \mu N \leq 0`, slip as the plastic flow, and the
tangential force as the stress-like internal variable. The interface force is *not* a function of
the current configuration -- two loading histories ending at the identical displacement field
carry different locked-in tangential forces (hysteresis is precisely this memory). The converged
tangential force :math:`\boldsymbol{t}_T^{(n)}` per slave is the minimal state that makes the
incremental problem well-posed. A stateless incremental law (:math:`\boldsymbol{t}_T = k_T \Delta
\boldsymbol{u}_T`, reset each increment) would make a stuck block creep by :math:`\tau / k_T`
*per increment* under constant sub-limit shear -- a response proportional to the number of
increments, never converging under time-step refinement.

Storing the *force* (rather than accumulated slip) is deliberate: total relative slip is not even
well-defined across increments here -- the frozen frame rotates and the assigned facet changes as
a node slides across the master surface -- whereas the force transfers cleanly (it is projected
onto the new tangent plane at each connectivity update, and zeroed when contact is lost).

Predictor--corrector (radial return)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All frictional kinematics live in the frozen small-sliding frame (``mu > 0`` requires
``sliding=small``). With the tangent-plane projector :math:`\bar{\boldsymbol{P}} = \boldsymbol{I}
- \bar{\boldsymbol{n}} \otimes \bar{\boldsymbol{n}}` and the incremental relative displacement
:math:`\Delta \boldsymbol{u}_{rel} = \boldsymbol{G}\, \Delta \boldsymbol{q}` (:math:`\Delta`
relative to the last converged state, i.e. computed from the solver's :math:`d\boldsymbol{U}`
fresh in every iteration -- nothing accumulates across Newton iterations, which also makes
cutbacks automatically state-safe):

.. math::

   \boldsymbol{t}^{trial} &= \boldsymbol{t}_T^{(n)} - k_T\, \bar{\boldsymbol{P}}\, \Delta
   \boldsymbol{u}_{rel}, \qquad k_T = t\, A_s \quad (\texttt{tangentPenalty}\ t), \\[4pt]
   \boldsymbol{t}_T &= \begin{cases} \boldsymbol{t}^{trial}, & \lVert \boldsymbol{t}^{trial}
   \rVert \leq \mu N \quad \text{(stick)} \\[2pt] \mu N \, \dfrac{\boldsymbol{t}^{trial}}{\lVert
   \boldsymbol{t}^{trial} \rVert}, & \text{otherwise (slip: radial return onto the cone)}
   \end{cases}

with :math:`N = -f_n \geq 0` the current normal force (multiplier-augmented if AL is active).
The force on the slave node is :math:`\boldsymbol{t}_T` and the facet nodes receive the reaction
:math:`-\bar{N}_a \boldsymbol{t}_T`, i.e. the assembly is :math:`\boldsymbol{P}^{ext}
\mathrel{+}= \boldsymbol{G}^T \boldsymbol{t}_T = \boldsymbol{c} \otimes \boldsymbol{t}_T`.

Note the continuity at liftoff: as :math:`N \to 0` the slip branch caps the force at :math:`\mu N
\to 0`, so the frictional force is continuous through gap activation. The *tangent*, however, is
only continuous there if the normal stiffness vanishes at activation -- the quadratic-law
argument above.

On increment acceptance (the constraint's ``acceptLastState`` lifecycle hook, called by
:meth:`~edelweissfe.models.femodel.FEModel.advanceToTime` alongside the element state commit),
the tangential force of the converged iterate is promoted to the history:
:math:`\boldsymbol{t}_T^{(n+1)} \leftarrow \boldsymbol{t}_T`.

.. _friction-tangent:

Consistent tangent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With :math:`\boldsymbol{K} = -\partial \boldsymbol{P}^{ext} / \partial \boldsymbol{U}` and the
Kronecker identities above:

**Stick** (symmetric, positive semi-definite):

.. math::

   \boldsymbol{K}^{stick} = \boldsymbol{G}^T \big( k_T \bar{\boldsymbol{P}} \big) \boldsymbol{G}
   = (\boldsymbol{c} \otimes \boldsymbol{c}^T) \otimes \big( k_T \bar{\boldsymbol{P}} \big).

**Slip** (nonsymmetric): differentiating :math:`\boldsymbol{t}_T = \mu N \hat{\boldsymbol{s}}`
with :math:`\hat{\boldsymbol{s}} = \boldsymbol{t}^{trial} / \lVert \boldsymbol{t}^{trial}
\rVert`, :math:`\partial N / \partial \boldsymbol{q} = -(\partial f_n / \partial g)\,
\boldsymbol{w}^T` and :math:`\partial \hat{\boldsymbol{s}} / \partial \boldsymbol{q} =
-\tfrac{k_T}{\lVert \boldsymbol{t}^{trial} \rVert} (\boldsymbol{I} - \hat{\boldsymbol{s}} \otimes
\hat{\boldsymbol{s}}) \bar{\boldsymbol{P}} \boldsymbol{G}`:

.. math::

   \boldsymbol{K}^{slip} = \underbrace{\mu \, \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial g} \, (\boldsymbol{c}
   \otimes \hat{\boldsymbol{s}}) \otimes \boldsymbol{w}}_{\text{normal--tangential coupling,
   nonsymmetric}} \; + \; (\boldsymbol{c} \otimes \boldsymbol{c}^T) \otimes \left[ \frac{\mu N
   k_T}{\lVert \boldsymbol{t}^{trial} \rVert} \big( \boldsymbol{I} - \hat{\boldsymbol{s}}
   \otimes \hat{\boldsymbol{s}} \big) \bar{\boldsymbol{P}} \right].

The bracketed second term is symmetric (:math:`\hat{\boldsymbol{s}} \perp \bar{\boldsymbol{n}}`
implies the two projectors commute); the rank-one coupling term is not. The linear solvers used
by the implicit solver operate on general unsymmetric matrices (e.g. the PARDISO interface runs
``mtype = 11``), so no symmetrization is applied. Both regimes of the tangent are verified
against independent finite differences of the assembled residual to relative errors of
:math:`\sim 10^{-11}`.

Parameter guidance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``tangentPenalty`` :math:`t` regularizes stick; the stick window (elastic reversal length) is
  :math:`\delta_{stick} \approx \mu N / k_T` per node. Choose it such that
  :math:`\delta_{stick}` is *well below* the expected slip per increment but not so stiff that
  the collective stick-to-slip transition at sliding onset makes Newton oscillate -- in practice
  one to two orders of magnitude softer than the normal penalty. (The physics is insensitive to
  this choice: the sliding plateau :math:`T/N = \mu` is exact for any regularization.)
* ``penalty`` :math:`p` sets the penetration :math:`g \approx -N_s / (p A_s)` (linear) or
  :math:`g \approx -\sqrt{2 N_s / (p A_s)}` (quadratic). With ``augmentedLagrange=True`` the
  multiplier absorbs the load over the increments and :math:`p` can be chosen an order of
  magnitude lower for the same (or better) penetration control.
* Use ``type=quadratic`` whenever friction is active (see above); ``type=linear`` is appropriate
  for frictionless cases and yields the cleanest analytic correspondence (e.g. in patch tests).


Solver integration
------------------

The constraint participates in the implicit solution through three hooks:

``updateConnectivity(model)`` (once per increment, before the equation system is (re)built)
    Re-assigns every slave to its closest facet from the last converged configuration (clamped
    closest point for small sliding, centroid distance for finite sliding), refreshes the frozen
    projection data, rotates the frictional history into the new tangent plane, zeroes the
    history and multiplier of slaves that lost contact, and reports whether the constraint's DOF
    footprint changed. The solver rebuilds the ``DofManager``/sparsity pattern only when some
    constraint reports a change. (All constraints are always polled -- the poll must not
    short-circuit, since every dynamic constraint relies on the call to refresh its state.)

``applyConstraint(U, dU, PExt, K, timeStep)`` (every Newton iteration)
    Assembles forces and consistent tangent from the current iterate, as derived above. All
    quantities derive from (converged state, :math:`d\boldsymbol{U}`); nothing accumulates
    across iterations, so failed increments and cutbacks need no state rollback.

``acceptLastState()`` (on increment acceptance)
    Promotes the tangential forces of the converged iterate to the frictional history and
    performs the incremental Uzawa update of the normal multipliers.

Per-slave results -- normal pressures :math:`p_s = -f_n/A_s`, tangential traction magnitudes,
gaps -- are exposed via ``getNormalPressures()`` / ``getTangentialTractions()`` / ``getGaps()``,
ordered like the generator's ``<prefix>_nodes`` node set, and are typically requested as
``fromExpression`` field outputs.


Verification and benchmarks
---------------------------

The implementation is verified on several independent levels, and the regression suite pins the
key physical invariants:

* **Derivatives**: the finite-sliding gap gradient and Hessian against SymPy symbolic
  differentiation and central finite differences (machine precision, random configurations); the
  small-sliding and frictional consistent tangents (stick, slip, with history, with facet motion,
  with AL, 2D and 3D) against finite differences of the assembled forces (relative error
  :math:`\sim 10^{-11}`).
* **Geometry**: clamped closest-point projections against brute-force barycentric grid searches;
  all face-triangulation tables against the mesh generators' actual node construction.
* **Patch test** (``...ContactPatch``): matching meshes, :math:`\nu = 0` -- uniform pressure to
  machine precision against the analytic value; the mismatched variant quantifies the intrinsic
  node-to-surface pointwise limitation.
* **Friction physics**: sliding plateau :math:`T/N = \mu` exactly (drag tests, 2D and 3D, hexa8
  and hexa20); the full hysteresis loop :math:`+\mu N \to` elastic unloading :math:`\to -\mu N`
  under drag reversal (``...FrictionHysteresis``); a two-interface shaft pull-out where the pull
  force approaches :math:`\mu` times the total confinement force, with the residual deviation
  explained by Poisson contraction of the shaft (``...PullOut``).
* **Curved interfaces** (``...CurvedHexa20``): midside vs corner triangulation on an identical
  curved hexa20 mesh; the corner reduction's chord sagitta acts as artificial gap and
  underestimates the total contact force by ~42 % in the committed configuration.
* **Augmented Lagrange**: at a 10x reduced penalty, the AL solution is closer to a stiff
  pure-penalty reference than a pure penalty at the same reduced value; one-step force-transfer
  and clamping of the Uzawa update are unit-checked.

Known, deliberate limitations: no self-contact (slave and master surfaces must not share nodes --
enforced at construction); single assigned facet per slave and increment; pointwise pressure
oscillation on non-matching meshes and serendipity-face corner liftoff as discussed in
:ref:`tributary-areas`; the finite-sliding branch retains its seam non-smoothness and dead zones
and is effectively superseded by ``sliding=small`` for the intended applications.
