"""Registry-facing factory for the Intel MKL PARDISO solver.

The implementation lives in the Cython extension :mod:`edelweissfe.linsolve.pardiso.pardiso`, which
is optional -- it needs MKL at build time. The factory below therefore imports it lazily; see
:func:`createSolver`.
"""

def createSolver(opts) -> Callable:
    """Create a PARDISO-backed linear solver.

    The factory the ``linsolver`` registry category resolves for the name ``pardiso`` (see
    ``PLAN_INPUT_SYSTEM.md`` §9): every ``linsolve`` subpackage exposes this one signature, so that
    a third party can contribute a linear solver through an entry point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    opts
        The linear-solver options parsed from the solver's ``linsolverConfigFile``. Only
        ``opts["reuseSymbolicFactorization"]`` is consulted, defaulting to ``False``; ``opts`` is
        tolerated as any non-mapping (the implicit-static solver passes ``""`` when no configuration
        file is given), in which case that default applies.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable
        A :class:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.pardiso.pardiso.PardisoSolver` instance, which is callable
        as ``(A, b) -> x``.

    Raises
    ------
    ImportError
        If the optional ``pardiso`` extension was not built. This propagates deliberately:
        :func:`~edelweissfe.config.linsolve.getDefaultLinSolver` catches it to fall back to SciPy.
    """

    # Imported inside the function body, not at module scope: this extension is optional and
    # genuinely absent in installs built without MKL, and `getDefaultLinSolver` relies on catching
    # the ImportError to fall back to SciPy. At module scope that failure would instead hit anyone
    # who merely resolves this registry name.

    # Symbolic-factorization reuse across solves is only correct if the caller
    # can guarantee the sparsity pattern stays genuinely stable for the solver
    # instance's entire lifetime; it has been observed to silently produce wrong
    # (but not NaN, so undetected by the usual failure check) results for some
    # coupled-DOF problems. Off by default; opt in explicitly via
    # opts["reuseSymbolicFactorization"] = True once that has been verified safe
    # for the problem at hand.
