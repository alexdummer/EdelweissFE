"""The common base class every registered ``linsolver`` inherits, so the nonlinear solver can treat
all of them uniformly instead of special-casing per capability.

Every ``linsolve/<name>/__init__.py``'s ``createSolver(opts)`` factory returns an instance of a
:class:`LinearSolver` subclass, callable as ``(A, b) -> x``. :meth:`LinearSolver.setJournal` and
:meth:`LinearSolver.setModel` are part of that base contract with safe defaults, so a caller can call
either on *any* registered solver unconditionally, whether or not that particular solver actually uses
the information -- a solver that needs more than the default overrides it; everything else inherits a
default that does nothing harmful.

:meth:`setModel` replaced what used to be a growing pile of individual, per-capability setters
(``setFieldStructure``, then ``requestedP1FieldNames``/``setP1Maps`` for p-multigrid, then
``requestedNodeCoordinateFieldNames``/``setNodeCoordinates`` for a rigid-body near null-space) with
one method, which simply hands a solver the live :class:`~edelweissfe.models.femodel.FEModel`
and :class:`~edelweissfe.numerics.dofmanager.DofManager` it is solving for. Every one of those
capabilities turned out to be derivable from those two objects alone (field layout from the
``DofManager``, node coordinates and element topology from the ``FEModel``), so a solver that wants
more than the base class's default field-structure bookkeeping (e.g. ``blockamg`` building a P1
topology map or reading node coordinates) can simply keep the references and compute whatever it needs
lazily, on its own schedule -- the driver no longer has to know in advance what any given solver might
want, query it, and push the answer back before every solve. :meth:`setFieldStructure` remains as a
lower-level escape hatch for callers that know the field-block layout directly but have no full model
to hand over (e.g. an offline probe script replaying a captured system).

        The nodal dimension of the field: the number of components per node (e.g. ``3`` for a 3D

        does not need but solver tuning does (e.g. why a preconditioner was rebuilt). Empty unless the
