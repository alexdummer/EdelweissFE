"""Registry-facing factory for the Panua PARDISO solver.

The implementation lives in the Cython extension
:mod:`edelweissfe.linsolve.panuapardiso.panuapardiso`, which is optional -- it needs the Panua
PARDISO library at build time. The factory below therefore imports it lazily; see
:func:`createSolver`.
"""

from collections.abc import Callable


def createSolver(opts) -> Callable:
    """Create a Panua-PARDISO-backed linear solver.

    The factory the ``linsolver`` registry category resolves for the name ``panuapardiso`` (see
    ``PLAN_INPUT_SYSTEM.md`` §9): every ``linsolve`` subpackage exposes this one signature, so that
    a third party can contribute a linear solver through an entry point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    opts
        The linear-solver options parsed from the solver's ``linsolverConfigFile``. Not consulted:
        this backend takes no options. It is still accepted so that every ``createSolver`` presents
        the identical signature.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable
        :func:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.panuapardiso.panuapardiso.panuaPardisoSolve`, i.e. a stateless
        ``(A, b) -> x`` function.

    Raises
    ------
    ImportError
        If the optional ``panuapardiso`` extension was not built.
    """

    # Imported inside the function body, not at module scope: this extension is optional and
    # genuinely absent in most installs, so at module scope its absence would break anyone who
    # merely resolves a `linsolver` registry name rather than this one.
