"""Registry-facing factory for the AMGCL algebraic-multigrid solver.

The implementation lives in the Cython extension :mod:`edelweissfe.linsolve.amgcl.amgcl`, which is
optional -- it needs the AMGCL headers at build time. The factory below therefore imports it lazily;
see :func:`createSolver`.
"""

from collections.abc import Callable, Mapping


def createSolver(opts) -> Callable:
    """Create an AMGCL-backed linear solver.

    The factory the ``linsolver`` registry category resolves for the name ``amgcl`` (see
    ``PLAN_INPUT_SYSTEM.md`` §9): every ``linsolve`` subpackage exposes this one signature, so that
    a third party can contribute a linear solver through an entry point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    opts
        The linear-solver options parsed from the solver's ``linsolverConfigFile``. Copied into a
        plain ``dict`` and handed to :class:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.amgcl.amgcl.PyAMGCLSolver`, which
        forwards it to AMGCL's own runtime parameter tree (solver/preconditioner selection and their
        tolerances). A non-mapping ``opts`` -- e.g. the ``""`` the implicit-static solver passes when
        no configuration file is given -- becomes an empty ``dict``, i.e. AMGCL's defaults.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable
        The bound :meth:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.amgcl.amgcl.PyAMGCLSolver.solve` method of a
        :class:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.amgcl.amgcl.PyAMGCLSolver` configured from ``opts``, i.e. a
        ``(A, b) -> x`` callable holding onto those options.

    Raises
    ------
    ImportError
        If the optional ``amgcl`` extension was not built.
    """

    # Imported inside the function body, not at module scope: this extension is optional, so at
    # module scope its absence would break anyone who merely resolves a `linsolver` registry name
