"""Registry-facing factory for the KLU (SuiteSparse) solver.

The implementation lives in the Cython extension :mod:`edelweissfe.linsolve.klu.klu`, which is
optional -- it needs SuiteSparse at build time. The factory below therefore imports it lazily; see
:func:`createSolver`.

    """SuiteSparse's KLU direct solver. Callable as ``(A, b) -> x``.

    A plain Python wrapper around the bare Cython function :func:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.klu.klu.kluSolve`
    -- not touching the ``.pyx`` itself keeps this trivially testable without a rebuild.

    The factory the ``linsolver`` registry category resolves for the name ``klu``: every ``linsolve`` subpackage
    exposes this one signature, so that a third party can contribute a linear solver through an entry point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    opts
        The linear-solver options parsed from the solver's ``linsolverConfigFile``. Not consulted:
        this backend takes no options. It is still accepted so that every ``createSolver`` presents
        the identical signature.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable
        A :class:`KLUSolver` wrapping :func:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.klu.klu.kluSolve`, callable as
        ``(A, b) -> x``.

    Raises
    ------
    ImportError
        If the optional ``klu`` extension was not built -- raised here, at construction time
        (matching the pre-refactor behaviour), not deferred to the first solve.
