"""
An Abaqus-style surface-to-surface tie constraint, bonding the nodes of a slave surface rigidly to
a deformable master surface via master-slave DOF elimination (multi-point constraint
condensation). Both surfaces are represented by flat contact facet elements
(:mod:`~edelweissfe.elements.contactsurfaceelement`, typically created via
:mod:`~edelweissfe.generators.surfaceelementgenerator`). Each slave node is projected onto its
closest master facet in the reference configuration; the clamped closest-point weights are frozen
and every displacement component of the slave node is constrained to the identically-weighted
master interpolation. The constraint is enforced exactly -- no penalty parameter, no Lagrange
multiplier DOFs -- and adds zero stiffness, which in particular leaves the critical time step of
explicit dynamics untouched.

    An Abaqus-style surface-to-surface tie constraint via master-slave DOF elimination.

    Theoretical background
    -----------------------
    Each slave node is projected onto its closest master facet once, in the reference
    configuration, using the clamped closest-point search shared with the small-sliding contact
    formulation. The resulting non-negative facet weights :math:`N_a` are frozen, and every
    displacement component of the slave node is constrained linearly to the master facet nodes:

    .. math::
        u_s = \\sum_a N_a \\, u_{m_a}.

    The constraint records are collected by the solver and enforced by condensing the slave DOFs
    out of the equation system (see
    :class:`~edelweissfe.numerics.mpctransformation.MultiPointConstraintTransformation`) -- the
    identical mechanism serves the implicit solvers (system matrix transformation) and explicit
    dynamics (mass/force folding onto the masters, direct kinematic slaving). The enforcement is
    exact for arbitrary meshes; the interpolation across a master facet is the facet's own linear
    one, so a linear displacement field is transferred exactly (patch test) for matching and
    non-matching meshes alike, on straight-edged hexa20 faces included.

    Currently only the 'displacement' field is tied. Available for spatialdomain = 3D (Tria3
    facets) and 2D (Line2 facets).
