"""L3 lazy registry for the input-language redesign (see ``PLAN_INPUT_SYSTEM.md``, P1).

Maps ``(category, name)`` to the implementing object (a class, or occasionally a factory
function -- see the coverage notes below) that EdelweissFE's own modules or third-party packages
(EdelweissMeshfree, plugins) provide for that name.

Four properties are load-bearing; the first three are each covered by a dedicated test in
``tests/test_registry.py``:

1. **Zero eager imports.** Importing this module must not import any element, material, solver,
   or output-manager module -- it only ever imports :mod:`importlib` and
   :mod:`importlib.metadata`. Resolving a name (importing the module that actually implements it)
   happens exclusively inside :func:`lookup`, on first use of that particular ``(category,
   name)`` pair.
2. **Built-ins work with a stale editable install.** Entry points declared in a package's
   ``pyproject.toml`` only materialize in ``importlib.metadata`` after ``pip install -e .`` is
   re-run -- so a registry that relies solely on entry-point discovery would leave a fresh
   checkout of EdelweissFE itself broken until someone remembers to reinstall it. To avoid that,
   EdelweissFE's own modules are additionally listed in the static ``_BUILTINS`` table below as
   plain ``"module.path:AttrName"`` strings -- ordinary Python string literals, requiring no
   metadata regeneration whatsoever -- and entry points are layered *on top* of that table for
   third-party discovery.
3. **Thread-safe memoization.** ``lookup()`` caches the resolved object in ``_resolved`` so a
   given ``(category, name)`` is only imported once. Under free-threading (``PYTHON_GIL=0``),
   multiple threads can call ``lookup()`` for the same key concurrently; see the docstring of
   :func:`lookup` for the chosen strategy.
4. **Names are case-insensitive, deliberately, and that belongs here rather than in the input-file
   front-end.** Both ``category`` and ``name`` are casefolded on the way in (:func:`lookup`,
   :func:`register`) and stored casefolded in ``_BUILTINS``. This is not a convenience shortcut and
   should not be "corrected" to exact matching: the whole point of this registry is that an
   external package (EdelweissMeshfree, a plugin) reaches these modules *without* the ``.inp``
   parser in the loop, so if case-insensitivity lived only in the parser, the same name would
   resolve differently depending on which front-end it arrived through. It is also what 12 of the
   13 ``config/*.py`` registries this replaces already did via ``name.lower()``; the lone
   exception, ``config/solvers.py``, is case-sensitive, so solver names becoming case-insensitive
   is this registry's one behavioral change (strictly more permissive -- no existing ``.inp``
   changes meaning). See rule (c) in ``PLAN_INPUT_SYSTEM.md`` §3, amended to say so. Casefolded keys
   widen the window for registration collisions, which is why every way of claiming a name now
   raises :class:`RegistryConflictError` instead of silently overwriting -- see that class.

Built-in coverage
------------------
The ``_BUILTINS`` table below currently covers these categories, enumerated by hand from the
corresponding ``edelweissfe`` subpackage (see the module docstring history / this branch's report
for exactly how each list was derived):

``outputmanager``, ``section``, ``constraint``, ``stepaction``, ``generator``,
``analyticalfield``, ``solver``, ``step``, ``modelmodifier``, ``statetransferstrategy``.

It deliberately does **not** yet cover:

- ``element`` and ``material`` -- ``config/elementlibrary.py`` and ``config/materiallibrary.py``
  dispatch on a *second* axis (``provider``: ``edelweiss`` vs. ``marmot`` vs.
  ``marmotsingleqpelement``) that changes the lookup semantics entirely (e.g. ``marmot`` ignores
  ``name`` and always returns the same wrapper class). Folding that into a flat ``(category,
  name)`` registry requires a design decision (does ``name`` encode the provider too?) that is out
  of scope for P1 and left to P4, alongside the other 11 ``config/*.py`` registries.
- ``linsolver`` -- ``config/linsolve.py``'s entries are not uniformly "a dotted string to a plain
  class/callable": ``superlu``/``umfpack`` are inline ``lambda`` closures with no module-level
  name to point a dotted string at, and ``gmres``/``amgcl`` require constructing a wrapper object
  with call-site-specific options before the usable callable exists. Left to P4.

This is a genuine subset, not full coverage dressed up -- do not extend call sites to assume every
category is present until P4 actually finishes the fold-in.

        The registry category (e.g. ``"outputmanager"``, ``"stepaction"``).
    name
        The name within that category (e.g. ``"ensight"``, ``"dirichlet"``).

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[Any, type | None]
        ``(target, schema)``. Along the dotted-string paths (built-in table and entry points) the
        schema is obtained from the resolved target itself via
        :func:`edelweissfe.utils.schema.schemaOf` -- i.e. the target declares it as a class
        attribute by deriving from
        :class:`edelweissfe.utils.schema.OptionSchemaProvider`. It is ``None`` for targets that
        declare no schema, which as of P2 is still most of them, and structurally always will be
        for the categories whose targets are plain functions rather than classes (see
        :func:`~edelweissfe.utils.schema.schemaOf`). :func:`register` may instead supply a schema
        explicitly, which takes precedence because it writes straight into the memo cache.

    Raises
    ------
    RegistryLookupError
        If no implementation is registered for ``(category, name)``.
    RegistryConflictError
        If two implementations claim ``(category, name)`` -- two entry points, or an entry point
        against a built-in (see :func:`_auditEntryPoints`).
