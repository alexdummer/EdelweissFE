"""P4's regression gate (see PLAN_INPUT_SYSTEM.md): no documented module may have an import-time
side effect that depends on, or damages, the import order.

Rule (a) of the target architecture is "no import side effects". Today's modules break it by
construction -- each declares its grammar in a one-shot ``for module in modules:`` loop that reads
``inputLanguage["step"]`` at import time -- so this gate does not assert the rule outright. It
asserts the two consequences that are observable from outside and that a refactor can regress:

1. **Every documented module imports standalone**, in an interpreter where nothing else from
   ``edelweissfe`` has been imported. This is the P4 checkpoint's wording, and it is what makes a
   module reusable by an external caller (EdelweissMeshfree, a script) rather than only by the
   parser. All modules satisfy it today, so this is purely a guard.
2. **No documented module poisons the parser by being imported first.** This is the stronger and
   more valuable half, because it is the failure this project keeps rediscovering, and it was *red*
   when this gate was written: importing ``outputmanagers.ensight`` or ``stepactions.options`` before
   ``utils.inputfileparser`` made the parser raise
   ``ValueError: options is not a valid argument``. Both had one cause -- ``stepactions/options.py``
   declaring the shared ``options`` keyword in a one-shot import-time loop that silently did nothing
   when it ran before any step type existed, with ``sys.modules`` then denying it a second chance.
   Fixed by declaring that keyword lazily and idempotently; see ``_ensureOptionsKeyword``.

Each check runs in a **fresh subprocess** per module, which is the only way to test an import-order
property, and the reason this file is slower than the rest of the suite. The subprocesses run
concurrently, and a failure reports *every* offending module rather than only the first, because
these bugs come in families with one shared cause -- seeing all of them together is what points at
the cause instead of at a symptom.
