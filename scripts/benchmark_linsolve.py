"""Offline benchmark of linear-solver strategies on a captured sequence of equation systems.

Reads what the ``matrixdump`` linear solver wrote (see
:mod:`edelweissfe.linsolve.matrixdump.matrixdump`) and replays it, so solver variants are compared
on byte-identical input instead of by rerunning the simulation. Each check is a separate subcommand
because they cost wildly different amounts of time: ``pattern`` is seconds, ``reuse`` and ``threads``
are minutes, and ``lagged`` involves a SuperLU factorization of the whole system and can run much
longer. Nothing here mutates the dumps.

Usage::

    python benchmark_linsolve.py pattern  <dumpDir>
    python benchmark_linsolve.py reuse    <dumpDir>
    python benchmark_linsolve.py threads  <dumpDir> [--threads 1,4,8,16,36]
    python benchmark_linsolve.py lagged   <dumpDir> [--maxiter 200] [--rtol 1e-8]

``threads`` must be run one thread count per process -- MKL latches its thread count at first use, so
sweeping inside a single process would silently measure the first setting repeatedly. The subcommand
therefore re-executes itself once per value.

    Projecting the whole sequence onto one common pattern -- keeping the extra entries as explicitly

    prices the fix: it is what the solver would see if the assembly stopped pruning zeros per

    The union over the captured iterations is a proxy for that fixed pattern, and a slightly generous
    one: it converges to the true unpruned pattern from below as more iterations are included, so any
